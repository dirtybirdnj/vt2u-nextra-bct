# About VT2U

Welcome to our website. Maybe you have questions about a strange video you saw on YouTube, or you saw a sticker somewhere in a bathroom at a ski resort.

You have questions, and that's understandable.

VT2U is a YouTube channel started by Mat Gilbert in 2019. His then girlfriend Monica bought him a GoPro 8 for christmas. A few days later Mat took the camera out on Lake Champlain and skated around, capturing what would end up being the first VT2U episode ever recorded.

The adventures continued and the episodes kept getting recorded. While the thumbnails and editing of the early episodes leaves something to be desired, they still show the excitement and entertainment that Mat and Monica experience as they journey across the state and beyond in search of adventure.

We have had the good fortune to travel to multiple states near and far to fish for things like Redfish and River Trout (not Take Trout!), and we've also been extremely fortounate to choose to make our home next to the shores of Lake Champlain.

While we came to the state for Skiing and Snowboarding, fishing quickly became a favorite activity during the beautiful summer months in Vermont.

We hope to show you a window into the things we enjoy most, the places and people that make Vermont an inrcredible and exceptional place.

The old saying goes you can't get there from here, and while we appreciate you reading about us we encourage you to go watch an episode, leave a comment and GET OUT THERE!

Come along as we bring Vermont 2U!
