# Lake Trout Fishing

One of our favorite activities is fishing for Lake Trout on Lake Champlain!

Originally introduced as a summer activity, vertical jigging for Lake Trout or Lakers on the broad lake quickly became a summer addiction... and then a winter persuit too.

They grow very large, they put up a great fight and the way you target them using the fishfinder provides a direct feedback on whether your fishing in the right place or not!

During the summer we go out on boats or kayaks (or paddleboards?!) and during the winter Mat drags out ice fishing tents and sleds while Monica tells him he's crazy and goes Snowboarding instead.
